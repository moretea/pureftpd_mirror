What is this?
-------------
This is a mirror of the pure-ftpd versions. 
It is automatically generated by the update.rb ruby script, to give us 
some idea what changed between the different releases.

Personally, I plan to use this repository to fork from these stable 
releases for custom projects, and to rebase on / merge with upstream 
code easily.

Requirements for running update.rb
----------------------------------
If you plan to run the update.rb script yourself, you need to have 
git and a recent ruby (>= 1.9.2) installed.
